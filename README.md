# Single Linked List Implementation in C++
This project is a simple implementation of a Single Linked List in C++, created as part of a C++ course assignment. It serves as a foundational introduction to linked list data structures, focusing on basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. This repository is ideal for beginners who want to understand the inner workings of linked lists.

## Features
- Insertion Operations:
   - addFirst: Add a new node at the beginning of the list.
   - addLast: Add a new node at the end of the list.

- Deletion Operations:
   - removeFirst: Remove the first node from the list.
   - removeLast: Remove the last node from the list.

- Traversal:
   - print: Display all elements currently in the list.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of running C++ programs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/be4ko/linked-list-cpp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder
```
cd linked-list-cpp
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
./linked-list
```
